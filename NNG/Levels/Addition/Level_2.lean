Introduction
"
It's well-known that $(1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)$; if we have three numbers
to add up, it doesn't matter which of the additions we do first. This fact
is called *associativity of addition* by mathematicians, and it is *not*
obvious. For example, subtraction really is not associative: $(6 - 2) - 1$
is really not equal to $6 - (2 - 1)$. We are going to have to prove
that addition, as defined the way we've defined it, is associative.

See if you can prove associativity of addition.

Statement MyNat.add_assoc

"On the set of natural numbers, addition is associative.
In other words, for all natural numbers $a, b$ and $c$, we have
$ (a + b) + c = a + (b + c). $"
    (a b c : ℕ) : (a + b) + c = a + (b + c) := by
  Hint "Because addition was defined by recursion on the right-most variable,
  use induction on the right-most variable (try other variables at your peril!).

  Note that when Lean writes `a + b + c`, it means `(a + b) + c`. If it wants to talk
  about `a + (b + c)` it will put the brackets in explictly."
