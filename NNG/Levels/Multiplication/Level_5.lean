Introduction
"
We now have enough to prove that multiplication is associative.

## Random tactic hint

You can do `repeat rw [mul_succ]` to repeat a tactic as often as possible.

Statement MyNat.mul_assoc
"Multiplication is associative.
In other words, for all natural numbers $a$, $b$ and $c$, we have
$(ab)c = a(bc)$."

-- TODO: old version introduced `rwa` here, but it would need to be modified
-- as our `rw` does not call `rfl` at the end.
