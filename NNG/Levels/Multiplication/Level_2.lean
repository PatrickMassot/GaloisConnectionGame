Introduction
"
In this level we'll need to use

* `one_eq_succ_zero : 1 = succ 0 `

which was mentioned back in Addition World  (see \"Add\" tab in your inventory) and
which will be a useful thing to rewrite right now, as we
begin to prove a couple of lemmas about how `1` behaves
with respect to multiplication.
