Level 1
Title "The rfl tactic"

Introduction
"
Each level in this game involves proving a mathematical statement. In this first level
you have three natural numbers $x, y, z$ (listed under \"Objects\") and you want to prove
$xy + z = xy + z$ (displayed under \"Goal\").

You can modify the Goal using *Tactics* until you can close it (i.e. prove it).

The first tactic is called `rfl`, which stands for \"reflexivity\",
a fancy way of saying that it will prove any goal of the form `A = A`. It doesn't matter how
complicated `A` is, all that matters is that the left hand side is exactly equal to the right hand
side. I really mean \"press the same buttons
on your computer in the same order\" equal. For example, `x * y + z = x * y + z` can be proved by `rfl`,
but `x + y = y + x` cannot.
